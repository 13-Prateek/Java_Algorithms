## What is Open-Source?
A trendy term among developers is the word “open-source”. As beginners, we’ve all heard older developers say, this project is open-source, or that project is open-source… What, then, does it mean for a project to be open-source?

In straightforward terms, open-source projects are projects with public source codes available to everyone to be modified and enhanced. It provides a collaborative way for developers to review, use, modify and distribute projects under a permissive license.

More companies have recently opted to open source, including popular companies like Microsoft, Facebook, and Google. A good number of projects are hosted on Git providers like GitLab and GitHub, allowing developers to discover, fork, and contribute to them.

## Why Open-Source?
Open source provides an opportunity for young developers to get involved in the community and collaborate with other engineers to improve the innovation of various projects. This broadens their scope, improves their experience, and aids their learning.

Here are some reasons why contributing to open-source is essential:

Improving existing skills: Open-source provides a better way for you to practice your skills and exposes you to smart contributions made by other contributors.
Becoming a part of a community: There is nothing as exciting as being part of a group interested in the same things as you. The open-source community is a big one and very welcoming to all contributors.
Finding mentors and teaching others: The open-source community is the best place you can connect with those who are more skilled. Also, with every contribution, you share knowledge with other contributors.
Career boost: Open-source provides the best opportunity to increase your reputation and display your skill. A lot of career opportunities come from contributing to open-source projects.

## Basic Open-Source Elements
A typical open-source project comprises beneficial elements that make contributing easier. These elements are basically documentation, and they include the following:

Licence: Every open-source project has a Licence; this helps protect both the users and contributors. An open-source license guarantees that others can use, copy, modify, and contribute to your project without repercussions. It also protects you from sticky legal situations. You should avoid projects without a license
README File: A readme file explains all a contributor should know about a project. A good readme explains what the project does, why it is useful, how contributors can get started, and where exactly help is needed. README files are usually encompassing and self-explanatory, ensure you understand the README before contributing
Contribution Guidelines: A contribution guideline tells what is expected of a contributor. It explains how an audience can participate in a project. It includes information on how to file a bug report, suggestions for new features, the type of contributions that should be made, and the project roadmap. For effective contribution, follow the project’s stated guidelines.
Code Of Conduct: Like every other characteristic of a community, there are rules on what is expected of individuals in the community. The code of conduct helps set ground rules for the behaviors of all project participants. Enforcing a code of conduct ensures healthy, constructive community behavior. Be civil in your interactions within the community, and keep to the community-listed code of conduct.
